# What is Combine?
## Intro to Combine
Combine is a framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13 for handling asynchronous events in a declarative way. It allows developers to process values over time, such as user input or data from a network request, using a consistent and concise syntax. At its core, Combine uses publishers and subscribers to manage the flow of data. Publishers emit values and events, while subscribers receive and handle them. This setup makes it easier to manage complex chains of events, transform data, and handle errors, reducing the need for callback-based code and making the code more readable and maintainable.

## Key features
One of the key features of Combine is its ability to chain multiple operators to process data streams. For example, you can fetch data from an API, decode the JSON response, and update the UI—all with a few lines of code. Combine also integrates seamlessly with Swift’s Codable system, making it straightforward to work with custom data types. Additionally, Combine provides powerful tools for handling errors, allowing you to retry failed operations, provide fallback values, or handle errors gracefully. Overall, Combine simplifies the development of reactive and responsive iOS applications, making it an essential tool for modern iOS development.
